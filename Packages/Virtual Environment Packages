#Conda Virtual Environment Packages

When creating the virtual environment ran into an issue of a package not being recognised when installing through 'conda install'. The below link suggested installing pip 
first through conda, navigate to virtual_portfolio_env/bin then using pip install yfinance. Now it was already a package installed in my conda application, just not 
explicitly in this virtual environment, therefore the last command I used was'conda install -n virtual_portfolio_env yfinance'
